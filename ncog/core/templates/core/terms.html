        <h3>Ncog Privacy Policy<h3>
         
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how and when Ncog (“Ncog”) through its website located at ncog.co, which provides a service that analyzes a user’s relationships by looking at the user’s Facebook interactions and a few other variables to give the user (“you”) an analysis on the relationships that are important to you.  For simplicity, we'll refer to any or all of this as the "Service".  </p><p>

Ncog receives your information through our web application, email notifications, and other interactions with our Services. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy.

        Creating a Ncog Account and Profile Information: When you create a Ncog account, you must provide access credentials by connecting through another service such as Facebook, we may use public information from that connected account to help complete your Ncog profile. We will collect your user name, user id number, profile picture and certain other information from Facebook.  You may update or modify your profile information and contact information at any time by updating that connected account, sign out of Ncog and then sign back in to have that information updated on your Ncog account.</p><p>
         
         
        Links: We may keep track of how you interact with links across our Services, including our email notifications, third-party services, and client applications, by redirecting clicks or through other means. We do this to help improve our Services, for example to provide relevant advertising, and to be able to share aggregate click statistics such as how many times a particular link was clicked on.</p><p>
         
        Third-Party Service Providers: Ncog uses a variety of third-party services to help provide our Services, such as hosting, and to help us understand the use of our Services, such as Facebook, and analytics.

        Law and Harm: Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Ncog’s rights or property.
